# DJHEvents
This is an informative website for a company that works in events.

The client requested a website that would provide his customers with information on what his company would provide. The website needed to be fully customizable, down to the base colour of the website.

The client picked an HTML template and requested certain edits.

The website includes the following:
- An updatable home page, using crispy_forms and tabs. I split the form into two sections: Function and Aesthetic for ease of use.
- An Events model so the client can add everything their company covers.
- Bootstrap tabs to include subsections in each event, as requested during revisions with the client. I then had to add the subsections to the events form, and split this into three tabs: Function, Aesthetic and Subsections.
- A photogallery with the ability for the client to add captions to promote the locations they had been hired for.
- Facebook like and share button API.
